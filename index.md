### What is Morbus?
Morbus is similar to TTT, Among Us, Warcraft's Parasite, Unfortunate Spacemen and Mafia. It is a deception style game set in space. Your objective as a human is to find the 'imposter(s)', brood aliens disguised as humans, while fending off aliens. **United, we stand!**

Alternatively, as a brood alien, your objective is to find weak points in the human groups and strike when the time is right, attempting to convert all humans to your side. As a swarm alien, your job is to harass humans and absorb bullets for the brood aliens. You are weak alone, but in numbers, you are dangerous. **For the hive!**
